        It is totally first time to use html and github.
        I'm having some trouble with using this, but I'm getting better
        Honestly, I like html.

      <h2>Any learning from this assignment?</h2>
      <p>
        <br>
        I have learned basic structure of html and github
        I hope I would learn many things of html, JS, and CSS.

      <h2>Any resources you used to solve this assignment?</h2>
      <p>
        <br>
        I used piazza a lot. I didn't ask on Piazza by myself, but other
        classmates' question were really really helpful.
        I won't hesitate to use it when I get into trouble with doing the assignment.
